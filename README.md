This is a simple web-based Badminton Score Keeper built with HTML, CSS (Bulma), and JavaScript. It allows two teams to keep track of their scores, with options to set a winning score, increment each team's score, and reset the game. The interface is responsive and features visual feedback when a team wins. It's a great beginner-friendly project to practice DOM manipulation and interactive UI building.
